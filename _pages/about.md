I am currently an assistant professor at Hunan University, School of Mathematics. I recieved my Ph.D. in 2023 from Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in Mathematics under the supervision of [Jialin Hong](http://www.cc.ac.cn/staff/hjl.html). My email address is: zt@lsec.cc.ac.cn


My research interests are probability theory with focus on ergodicity, probability limit theorems (LDP, CLT, LLN), hitting probabilities, normal approximate and Stein method, etc.

Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
