I am a Ph.D student at Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences. My email address is: zt@lsec.cc.ac.cn


My research interests are probability theory with focus on interactions with statistical physics, theory of computer science and statistical inference: random walks, Gaussian processes, random constraint satisfaction problems, random planar geometry, spin models, random Schrodinger operators, network recovery problems, etc.
