I am currently a postdoctoral fellow at PolyU. I recieved my Ph.D. in 2023 from Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in Mathematics under the supervision of [Jialin Hong](http://www.cc.ac.cn/staff/hjl.html). My email address is: tau.zhou@polyu.edu.hk.


My research interests are probability theory with focus on optimal transport, nonlinear diffusion equations, ergodicity, probability limit theorems (LDP, CLT, LLN), hitting probabilities, normal approximate and Stein method, etc.
